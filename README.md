Introduction to Basic HTML5

**HTML**, or **HyperText Markup** Language, is a markup language used to describe the structure of a web page. It uses a special syntax or notation to organize and give information about the page to the browser. 

**Elements** usually have **opening** and **closing** tags that surround the content. The only difference between **opening** and **closing** tags is the **forward slash** inside the closing tag.

For example:

![HTML Element](/images/element.png)

The HyperText part of HTML existed since the early days of the web. Pages are static documents.

**HTML headings** are **titles** or **subtitles** that display on a webpage.

```
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

HTML headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.

The most important heading: `<h1>`
The least important heading: `<h6>`

### DIY Section

First, you'll start by building a simple web page using HTML.

Create three HTML heading tags:
 - Create a `<h1>` tag that contains a text that says “Hello World!"
 - Create a `<h2>` tag that contains a text that says “Hello World!"
 - Create a `<h3>` tag that contains a text that says “Hello World!"

You **must** pass **three tests** before submitting it.
